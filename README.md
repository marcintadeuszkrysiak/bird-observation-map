# Glacial Cycles Model

This project explores simplified models of glacialâ€“interglacial cycles using logistic and nonlinear dynamical systems.

**Goals:**
- Implement mathematical models of ice volume variation
- Compare synthetic outputs with paleoclimate data (e.g. EPICA, Vostok)
- Visualize glacial oscillations and explore chaotic behavior

**Tech stack:**
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Real-world paleoclimate datasets
-
